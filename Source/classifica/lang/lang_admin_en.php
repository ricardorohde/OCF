You should only disable this during the design customization of your site. You will much easier figure out which CSS declaration to change in which CSS file if the files are separate and uncompressed.<br><br>
Note, however, that there might be servers where combining doesn't work properly: if your server has been set up to put some content (typically, ads of the hosting service) automatically on the top of the pages that are served by Php, it can mess up the combined CSS and JavaScript.";

In some cases, it can make a good sense: e.g. if you have cars and only cars in every categories, probably all the categories have just the same list of custom fileds.

$lll["category_recursive"]="\"Deep\" listings";
$lll["category_recursive_expl"]="If this is enabled, the category listings and the search result lists of this category will contain all the ads of its sub categories, too.<br><br>
Note that this may not work in any case and whether it works or not, depends on the custom field configuration of the main and the sub categories! In Noah's, it is possible to define completely different custom fields in a sub category and in its main category. In such a case, the deep listing of the main category will lead to a wrong result, because the ads of the sub categories can't be reasonably placed in the same list as those of the main category (the columns mismatch!). Tips to avoid the column mismatch:<br>
<ul>
<li>If you create a new custom field in a category, check the 'Add this field to all the sub categories, too' option in the create form,</li>
<li>Try to set up a final custom field configuration for a category, before you create its sub categories (if you create a sub category, it \"inherits\" the fields of the main category)</li>
<li>Use the 'Clone into sub categories' option on the 'List of custom fields' page to \"harmonize\" the fields of a category with the fields of its sub categories.</li>

Relocating ads from one category into an other is possible with the 'move' feature on a per advertisement basis.
