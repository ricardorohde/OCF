Copyright (C) 2009 noahsclassifieds.org All Rights Reserved.
Last Updated: July 31, 2009
===============================================================================
 
 
By purchasing and installing or using Noah’s Classifieds, you (the user) are agreeing to the following terms. Do not install or use the script,
if any of these terms are not acceptable for you. If you have any questions, 
you may contact us at support@noahsclassifieds.org. 
 
 
1. USAGE: A single license allows you to install Noah’s Classifieds
   on only one domain name. If you want to setup more than one websites using 
   the script, you should obtain additional licenses from Noahsclassifieds.org.  
   Additional licenses are available at discount prices. Please visit our 
   website or email us for more information. You may find the contact 
   information in the Support Information section of this document. 
   
   You should NOT remove, alter or obfuscate any instances of the Noah’s Classifieds script's 
   name or copyright notices found in the administration area and PHP source 
   files. You are allowed to remove the copyright notice from the 
   end user side of the website with our only commercial versions and you must register your NOAH'S CLASSIFIEDS(ie. the homepage etc.).
 
2. CHANGE OF DOMAIN NAME: A script license is granted for a particular domain
   name. If you move the script to a new domain, then you should inform 
   Noahsclassifieds.org about the transfer for approval. Any such transfers 
   without the approval of Noahsclassifieds.org will void your script license.
 
3. TRANSFER OF LICENSE: If a website running Noah’s Classifieds is
   to be transferred to another party, along with the script, then you should 
   report the transfer to Noahsclassifieds.org prior to the transfer. 
   (No support is given to the party of transfer by Noah's CLassifieds, Inc. unless 
   new arrangements are made between the given parties).)
   Noahsclassifieds.org will have the right to prevent you from transferring the 
   script license and thus the script files to the new party, if the transfer 
   is found to be unacceptable. If approved by Noahsclassifieds.org, the transfer 
   of the website will also involve the transfer of your script license and 
   you will no longer be eligible to use the license further. Additionally, 
   any such transfers should retain the script's name and all the original 
   copyright notices including those in the administration area as well as 
   the source files and also contain an unaltered copy of this file.
 
4. REFUNDS: Payments made to Noahsclassifieds.org are final and shall NOT be 
   refunded under any circumstances. And you agree to this fully by Installing the Noah's CLassifieds Brand Software.
 
5. COPYRIGHTS: Noah’s Classifieds is copyright protected software. 
   All rights on the script are reserved by Live Transactions.Com, Inc. and Noahsclassifieds, Inc. 
   You may not resell or redistribute the script either Free, Lite, Pro or E-commerce, or any part of it, with or
